It's the business end of the Miami Open as we enter week two of the second leg of the coast-to-coast Sunshine Double. Hard Rock Stadium always goes all-out for the 1,000-point event, which provides our final taste of hard-court action before the clay-court swing.

Men's no.1 seed Carlos Alcaraz is still going strong. Through to the last 16 he faces Tommy Paul in what set up to be a sizzler this evening. In the meantime, Alexander Zverev, Dan Evans, Cameron Norrie, Casper Ruud, Frances Tiafoe and Matteo Berrettini have all fallen. It's the likes of Tsitsipas, Medvedev, Fritz and, of course Jannik Sinner who will be gunning for the Spaniard.

Victory at Indian Wells at the previous tournament saw Alcaraz return to world No.1, and with Novak Djokovic still unable to enter the US, the young Spaniard is the firm favorite in the men's draw. He's struck up his own burgeoning rivalry with Jannik Sinner, who might have several more titles to his name were it not for constantly coming up against Alcaraz in the draw. This time, thought, the two could meet in the final.

Iga Swiatek would have been the target in the women's competition but the defending champion and world No.1 had to withdraw from the tournament with a rib injury. Instead, it's down to the other two legs of the WTA triumvirate that's emerged to dominate the WTA. Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka have each won their most recent meetings with the Pole, and, while Rybakina beat both players en route to the Indian Wells title, Sabalenka got the better of Rybakina to win the Australian Open. 

Both are through to the quarter finals at the Miami Open, along with Jess Pegula, and Petra Kvitová.We're reaching the business end of the Miami Open as the Masters 1000 Events continues on Tuesday – and there are some more big matches to look forward to.

Novak Djokovic will not feature at the Miami Open due to his vaccination status, affording Alcaraz an opportunity to take a firm grip of the rankings until the Serbian has a chance to reply.

It has been a dismal outing for British players. Andy Murray, Kyle Edmund and Emma Raducanu were all dispatched in the first round, while seeded stars Cam Norrie and Dan Evans were also ditched at their first hurdles.
